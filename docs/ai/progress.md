## Now (start here)

**M6 (spec 006 — snapshots + diff) closed 2026-07-27. M7 is IN IMPLEMENTATION: all three Gear-3 gates are behind it — `spec.md` PASSED gate 1 (`e09520f`, three revisions, §3.4/§9-2/§9-3 dispositions recorded there), `plan.md` PASSED gate 2 (`c44406a`, approved at `cab93c7` with four sub-decisions — the D-5 ledger copy, version-bump-uses-eviction, the `architecture.md` correction routed to group 9, and the §7-9 flip-cost re-routed to gate 3), and `specs/007-mermaid-diagrams/tasks.md` (28 tasks, nine groups) PASSED gate 3 (banked in `decisions.md`'s M7 GATE 3 entry — `66634fa`; the tasks file's "DRAFT awaiting gate 3" status line stays, by the gate-1/gate-2 precedent). TASK 1.1 IS DONE (`2159e5c`): `mermaid@11.16.0` added as the FIFTH production dependency, with its four supply-chain gates discharged. TASK 1.2 IS DONE (this commit): `src/render/diagramEngine.ts` — the ONE module naming `import('mermaid')` (a static string literal the scanner permits), the feature-detect that keeps a fence-free document from ever evaluating it, D-6 step 3's configuration, and `engineVersion()` sourced from a STATIC `mermaid/package.json` import per the D-3/D-13 amendment (`bddd5af`) — mermaid exposes no runtime version. Imported by NOTHING, so both bundles are md5-identical to 1.1's. TASK 1.3 (THE ABLATION — the scratch `appShell.ts` reference, four outputs, every byte accounted) IS NEXT, and 1.2 hands it two named items: the static `mermaid/package.json` import inlines the WHOLE package.json, not a tree-shaken `version` — a named byte in 1.3's sub-block accounting; and the build-output proof that the static form emits NO bare specifier and NO orphan chunk is 1.3's, because at 1.2 the module is reachable from nothing and there is no emitted output to inspect.**

**★ BOTH FLAGS RAISED BY TASK 1.1 ARE NOW CLOSED — gate 3's approval banked (below), the SBOM defect
fixed at `1a202fd`. Neither ever blocked 1.2.**
- **CLOSED — Gate 3's approval IS NOW BANKED**, in `decisions.md` (the M7 GATE 3 entry, `66634fa`).
  M6 used a different shape: it landed `0e24f15 docs(tasks): M6 gate 3 — tasks 006 (snapshots + diff)
  approved and landed` **before** its task 1.1 (`a72f27f`), tasks and approval together. M7's tasks had
  already landed separately at `bfa131e` as an explicit draft, so only the written approval was
  outstanding and the bank entry is it. **`specs/007-mermaid-diagrams/tasks.md` still self-labels
  *"DRAFT awaiting gate 3"* at its header and footer, and that is CORRECT, not stale** — the gate-1/gate-2
  precedent puts approval in `decisions.md`, not the artifact's status line (spec 007 still reads "draft"
  post-`e09520f`; plan 007 still reads "draft — awaiting gate 2" post-`cab93c7`). **The decisions entry is
  the approval of record — do not "fix" the status line.**
- **CLOSED — `scripts/generate-sbom.ts` UNDER-REPORTED the production tree** (a latent defect that
  mermaid's depth was the first tree to expose), fixed at `1a202fd`: 90 → 120 components, dedup decoupled
  from descent. See § Blockers for the root cause and the proof.

M6 shipped snapshot capture on the app page, bounded retention (count 15 / 20 MiB / 30 days), a global
erase control, a persistent capture disclosure and an inline line-diff against any stored snapshot —
with **`permissions: []` intact** and the first `dependencies` addition since M1 (`diff@^9.0.0`). The
9.1 human gate PASSED and found three layout defects plus a disclosure gap, all fixed before close.
**The close record, the group summaries, the five recovery sessions, the two formal retractions and the
frozen M6-close pins are in [`progress-archive.md` § M6](progress-archive.md#m6--spec-006--snapshots--diff--closed-2026-07-27);
task-by-task detail is `specs/006-snapshots-diff/tasks.md`. Neither is restated here.**

**Two M6 facts that outlive the milestone — do not re-derive them from its narrative:**
- **The running human-gate score is 10/10**, corrected from the 8/8 written at 9.1 (the score counts
  DEFECTS: 7 before M6, M6 contributes 3). See § Closed milestones.
- **"None escaping" is FALSE for the first time.** Finding A shipped since M3 and was missed at three
  close gates, so nine of ten defects were caught at their own gate and **one escaped three**. The
  mechanical cause is that **no gate record on any milestone states the walk's VIEWPORT** — a gate
  walk now records its viewport the way it records its engines (`retro.md` 2026-07-27, finding 2).

**M7's direction and scope are SETTLED and live in § Up next** — the direction decision was banked at
`87cd026` and all three Gear-3 gates are behind it. No flag is outstanding there.

**The Now-pointer advances PER TASK** (the M1 rule — it once lagged four tasks and the next session
acted on stale state). The rule has four recorded failures and one mechanical remedy: **a pointer walk
as a discrete step in every gate-closing task** (`retro.md` 2026-07-27, finding 3) — grep `is next`,
`at the gate`, `waiting on`, `this commit`, `← NEXT` and the running score before committing. **This
archive pass ran that walk on itself.**


## Up next

### M7 (spec 007) — persona #1 completion via M7a (Mermaid + diagram cache) · IN IMPLEMENTATION, group 1

**Scope is SETTLED and all three gates are behind it** (see § Now). M7a is **Mermaid + a diagram
cache**; the rest of persona-#1 quality-of-life (compare-any-two-files, agent-file awareness, table
tools) is on spec §6's IS-NOT fence and is **not** in this milestone. The argument that selected it:
six milestones landed almost entirely inside persona #1's column,
[`spec-coverage.md`](spec-coverage.md) puts that column at **~56%**, and the largest remaining hole in
it is the one item that needs a dependency Peekover has never installed.

**Implementation runs task-by-task from `specs/007-mermaid-diagrams/tasks.md`, one commit per task,
this pointer advancing in that same commit.** Next: **1.2**.

- **DISCHARGED, recorded so it is not re-raised: the persona-#1 completion decision IS NOW BANKED** in
  `decisions.md` (`87cd026`, the M7 DIRECTION entry). The archive pass's flag is closed.
- **M7 owes a FLOOR-DELTA STATEMENT before any further first-paint re-baseline discussion**
  (`retro.md` 2026-07-27, finding 8), plus the optimisation question `decisions.md` 2026-07-26 routed
  to it — 006's +15.7 KB content-script growth is legitimate but, per the human note at 9.1, not
  sacred.
- **Before the first task of any group, re-read the standing rules that keep costing time when
  skipped:** `docs/ai/decisions.md` (the harness ledger, the dead ends, the both-engines gate
  procedure) and `docs/ai/retro.md` (newest entry first).


### Carried items
*Banked deliberately, each with a recorded home. Do NOT guess at any of them; every one is either
measurement-driven or explicitly deferred.*

- **★ THE WATCH PILL IS NOT DISCOVERABLE — the 7.1 gate's ONE finding, SHIPPED AS-IS by human decision,
  carried rather than filed as a defect.** Asked whether they would have found it unaided, the human said
  **no**: bottom-left, third in a stack (network → theme → watch), unlabelled until looked at.
  **The placement is correct AND measured, which is why this is not a placement bug** — 4.1's throwaway
  probe ruled out top-right (collides with the TOC handle) and bottom-right (inside the TOC rail's live
  entry list) with real rects, and bottom-left was the only corner clearing everything. **"Right corner"
  and "discoverable" are different properties**, and the geometry offers nowhere better.
  **WHY IT SHIPS: discoverability is an ONBOARDING problem** (product spec F11), and **005 has no
  onboarding surface to hang a hint on**. Inventing chrome at a gate is how you get unwalked UI — the one
  thing this project's whole gate discipline exists to prevent. **REVISIT WHEN:** onboarding lands, or a
  first-run hint becomes cheap on an existing surface. Recorded in `decisions.md` (2026-07-21) with its
  reasoning; kept here so it survives into the next milestone instead of living only in a gate note.
- **A POLISH CANDIDATE, NOT A DEFECT — the anchor's visible correction (seen at 7.1).** When content is
  inserted above the reading position, the view **visibly moves up and then returns**: the browser holds
  `scrollTop` through `replaceChildren`, then the anchor corrects it. That is 5.1's measured **~2738 px**
  correction made visible — **correct behaviour with a slightly visible mechanism.** Any fix belongs with
  006's diff work (which knows *what* changed and could avoid the full replace), not with a scroll hack.
- **Comment-only nit, to ride along with the NEXT `src/render/tocView.ts` touch.** `clampTocWidth`'s doc
  comment claims a non-finite input yields `TOC_MIN_WIDTH` via NaN being "caught by the caller's guard".
  **Wrong twice; the CODE is right.** `Math.max(180, Math.min(480, NaN))` is **`NaN`** (it propagates, it
  is not clamped), and the caller does not "catch" it — `applyStoredTocWidth` guards with
  `Number.isFinite` and **returns early**, so `clampTocWidth` never sees a non-finite value. That guard is
  load-bearing: without it the restore path writes literal `"NaNpx"` and silently kills `--toc-w`.
  **Fix the comment only** — the function is *partial* on non-finite input, guarded by the caller.
- **Sepia stays DEFERRED** (D-1 = A; `design/tokens.css` defines only 4 of ~15 sepia tokens, so completing
  the palette is a brand/design decision, not an implementation fill). A candidate for a later themes pass.
- **Unify the two keyboard shortcuts on ONE host registry.** 003 left `` ` `` (TOC toggle) on a host
  registry while readerMode's `\` still resolves differently and is inert on the app page. The
  inconsistency is deliberate and recorded (decisions.md 2026-07-17) — **revisit at a settings/hardening
  pass, or the next time `readerMode`'s shortcut host-resolution is touched.**
- **Chunked/virtualized *TOC-tree* render** — the many-heading lever (003 §5.1: ~45 ms rail build @1401
  headings, scales ~linearly). **NOT forced for typical docs**; revisit at N-thousand headings
  (decisions.md 2026-07-17).
- **Chunked/virtualized *folder-tree* render** — the large-folder lever. 6.2 measured the pure
  walk+build+filter as **cheap** (~7 ms typical, ~40 ms at the 5000-file cap); the suspect is `treeView`
  laying out one DOM node per file+dir. **Decide from a real-browser tree-render measurement** (the
  deferred half of 6.2), not from a guessed bound.
- **Chunked/virtualized *reader* render** — the M1-carried large-*doc* first-paint lever (decisions.md
  2026-07-14). Same class, different surface; 003's 5.2 and 004's 7.1 both confirmed no first-paint
  regression, so it stays carried rather than forced. **005's 5.1 gives it a second, sharper motivation:
  a 1 MB WATCH re-render blocks the main thread for ~717 ms and cannot be interrupted (`mount()` has no
  scheduling and no abort), and unlike a first paint it happens repeatedly while the user is reading.**
  Still not forced — 5.2/5.3's coalescing is the cheaper lever first — but this is now the strongest
  evidence for it.
- **Restore GFM table alignment safely** (map to a class, never an inline style) — carried from M1;
  spec 003 §Out-of-scope leaves it to table work.
- **A shared browser-test helper module.** `flush()` / `afterFrames()` / `waitFor()` are duplicated
  verbatim across 6+ files (plan §4-7 named it; 005 added more). When it lands, the three instrument rules
  in `decisions.md` 2026-07-21 belong in it — and the stability-polling wait should **replace**
  `waitForScrollable`, not sit beside it.

**Roadmap:** 003 TOC/navigation ✓ · 004 themes+settings ✓ · **005 watch mode ✓** (the differentiator) ·
**006 snapshots + diff ✓** (closed 2026-07-27 — gate 9.1 PASSED, retro banked; running gate score **10/10**, corrected

… full order in `docs/product/spec.md` §Phase-1.

## Blockers / open questions

- **NOTHING IS BLOCKED. M7's three Gear-3 gates have all run AND ARE ALL BANKED IN WRITING** (gate 1
  `e09520f`, gate 2 `cab93c7`, gate 3 in `decisions.md`'s M7 GATE 3 entry — banked at `66634fa`, closing
  the flag task 1.1 raised; `tasks.md`'s "DRAFT awaiting gate 3" status line stays by precedent). **The next
  human gate is 8.4**, the cache bound-values / typical-case-target decision gate, and it is a long way
  out — groups 1–7 land first. M6's gates are all closed and recorded (spec gate 1 2026-07-22, plan
  gate 2 + gate-3 product decisions 2026-07-23, D-8's bound-value gate at 7.2 2026-07-26, close gate 9.1
  2026-07-26), alongside M5's three (2.3, 5.2, 7.1). *(This bullet has been corrected four times for
  pointer inversion — at 8.2, at 9.1, at the archive pass, and again at 007 task 1.1. It is the single
  most inversion-prone line in the file: it states pending human state, which is false by construction
  the next time anything ships.)*
- **RESOLVED, noted once so it is not re-opened: `scripts/generate-sbom.ts` no longer under-reports the
  production tree.** Found by 007 task 1.1 (which correctly did not take it — the file is outside 1.1's
  commit fence), fixed at **`1a202fd`** as its own act. **Root cause: `collect()` conflated DEDUP with
  DESCENT** — one `if (!acc.has(id))` gate both created the component and recursed, so a package was
  walked only on FIRST SIGHT, and `pnpm list --json` emits a repeated package **shallow** at its first
  occurrence in traversal order and **full** at exactly one later one. First sight is therefore precisely
  the childless occurrence. **Fix: the two concerns are now separate sets** — `acc` dedups, a new
  `expanded` set gates descent, so any node that actually carries children is walked. **Counts: 90 → 120
  `name@version` (113 distinct names); 30 recovered**, all of `d3@7.9.0`'s subtree plus `d3-dsv`'s
  children. **Proof, and it is graded against something other than itself:** a red-first unit test
  (`tests/sbomWalk.test.ts`, synthetic shallow-first/full-later fixture, revert-and-fail reproduced, with
  a firing control asserting the OLD walk drops exactly the shallow-first payload and keeps the
  full-first one), plus set-equality — not just count-equality — between the fixed generator and an
  **independent** `pnpm licenses list --prod --json` enumeration (a different pnpm subcommand that never
  reads the nested tree). **It was a pre-existing latent defect, not a mermaid regression:** the
  4-dependency tree had no diamond deep enough to produce a shallow-first pair, so it had never fired.
  CycloneDX version, output format and byte-determinism are unchanged (two runs byte-identical); the
  serial number moved because it digests the component list, which is the point.
- **Spec coverage audit** at [`spec-coverage.md`](spec-coverage.md) — **re-audited 2026-07-27 at HEAD
  `d470ab2`** (targeted: §6-4 and §6-9 only, after the §6 side-quest landed the CI those items named).
  **~17% of Phase 1's F1–F12 is shipped** by weighted item count (**§6 59%** — up from 56% — §7 67%,
  whole spec ~23%); **persona-#1 killer-feature coverage is ~56%** and is unchanged by the re-audit.
  Only 4 of §10's 14 stack layers are provisioned, and **F2/F3/F9/F10/F11 have never been touched by any
  milestone**. **Read before scoping M7.** *(It also half-answers the single-file-drop question below —
  see the audit's uncertain-items §1.)*
- **★ ONE GAP THE RE-AUDIT FOUND AND DID NOT FIX, because `.github/` is outside an archive pass's scope
  fence: the SBOM's release-attach step cannot fire on a tag push.** `supply-chain.yml`'s `on.push` is
  filtered to `branches: [main]` with **no `tags:` key**, so pushing `v0.1.0` triggers no run, and the
  `sbom` job's `if: startsWith(github.ref, 'refs/tags/')` step is reachable only by a manual
  `workflow_dispatch` against a tag ref. `decisions.md` 2026-07-27 says the step *"will fire on the first
  tag"* — **not supported by the trigger block as written.** The fix is one line (`tags: ['v*']`) and
  belongs with whoever cuts the first release, alongside §6-10's hashes and attestations. No tag has ever
  been cut (`git tag -l` is empty), so nothing is broken today.
- **GAPS IN AUTOMATED COVERAGE — closed as *findings*, still open as *coverage*. Plan for these; do not
  assume CI will catch a regression in them.** Per the harness ledger (decisions.md 2026-07-19 + the
  2026-07-21 addenda) there is **no roadmap to any of them**:
  - **The real content→background transport.** No test on any milestone has ever exercised it — the
    harness loads no extension, so `runtime.sendMessage` has no receiving end. **This is where M5's one
    shipping defect lived (4.8).** 4.8 added the closest reachable substitutes (a call-site pin and
    source-text pins on the entrypoint); **neither reaches the transport.**
  - **Firefox first paint and Firefox's watch re-render cost.** Playwright cannot load an extension into
    Firefox (upstream, closed out-of-scope), so both perf harnesses are Chromium-only by construction.
    Firefox's evidence is the human gate and nothing else.
  - **Local-disk `FileSystemObserver` latency.** No automated route to a local-disk handle exists; every
    harness number is an OPFS inference (confirmed once, at 5.1a — see § Watch-mode numbers).
  - **From M4 and still true:** the end-to-end settings/TOC round-trip through the background, and the
    cold-start theme flash.
- **OPEN QUESTION (an M2 finding, NOT an 004 defect — recorded so it is not lost). Dropping a single `.md`
  file onto the app page does nothing; only folders work.** Found by the human during the 8.1 session. 004
  touched no folder/drop code and this did not affect the gate result; it is **spec-002 / M2 territory**.
  **UNVERIFIED — do not assume either way.** The evidence points at folder-only **BY DESIGN** (the
  PERMISSIONS.md ledger describes only folder drop/pick; the architecture is folder-shaped throughout —
  `FolderSource → MarkdownFile[]`, `folderId`-keyed recents/pins, remembered directory handles, and a lone
  file has none of those) — **but that is inference from surrounding artifacts, not verification.**
  **Two checks would settle it:** (1) does `docs/product/spec.md` name "open a single file from the app
  page" as a feature at all? (2) does the drop handler bail **SILENTLY**? `getAsFileSystemHandle()`
  returns handles for files *and* directories, so it very likely checks `kind === 'directory'` — the real
  question is whether the user gets **any** feedback. **Worth flagging regardless of the answer:** a
  reasonable gesture producing total silence is its own small **never-blank (#5)** gap, and a line like
  *"Drop a folder — single files open directly from your file manager"* would close it cheaply.
  *Recorded only — not investigated, not fixed.*
- **RESOLVED, noted once so it is not re-opened: the `remoteMedia` positive-control flake is FIXED.** It
  now awaits the Resource-Timing entries instead of sampling for them (22/22 consecutive runs green, both
  engines; deliberate break goes red). Retro 2026-07-19's watch item is **discharged**; the rule and the
  structural reason only that file was ever at risk are in `decisions.md` 2026-07-21.

## Closed milestones

**M6 · spec 006 — snapshots + diff · CLOSED 2026-07-27.** Snapshot capture on the app page, bounded
retention (**count 15 / 20 MiB / 30 days**, D-8), a global erase control, a **persistent** capture
disclosure, and an inline line-diff against any stored snapshot — with **`permissions: []` still
intact**, the **FIRST `dependencies` addition since M1** (`diff@^9.0.0`, a governed act), `DB_VERSION`
2 → 3, and PERMISSIONS.md's *"file contents are never stored"* claim corrected **in the same commit as
the first stored byte** (1.4). Nine groups, **twenty planned tasks, ZERO discovered tasks** — but
**five unplanned recovery sessions the box list cannot see**, which is its own finding. The 9.1 gate
**PASSED and caught THREE layout defects plus a disclosure gap**, all fixed before close (`e231941`,
`8255380`); the first-paint gate was **re-baselined `<150` → `<165` ms** at the human's call.
**★ THE MILESTONE ALSO AUDITED ITS OWN PRIOR EVIDENCE HARD ENOUGH TO FIND IT HOLLOW — two formal
RETRACTIONS, a metric class M4 and M5 both scored zero on:** the import-fence grep proved nothing
(identifiers, minified bundle — the app chunk greps 0 too), and the coalescer never dropped anything
(a probe sampled once, unfalsifiable while the proposed byte bound clamped the count). Both retracted
claims were **unfalsifiable under the conditions they were measured in** — one defect class, not two.

values, the gate re-baseline) and 2026-07-27 (the §6 side-quest + the §6-17 correction) · lessons:
`retro.md` 2026-07-27 (the two retractions as one class; **every empirical claim needs a positive
control that fires**; the gate-score arithmetic; the broken "none escaping" invariant; the pointer-walk
rule; the sibling-checklist audit).

**M5 · spec 005 — watch mode · CLOSED 2026-07-21.** The Phase-1 differentiator: **watch a chosen local
markdown file and re-render it in place while an agent rewrites it**, both engines, both surfaces, with
**`permissions: []` intact**, **no new dependency** (still three) and **no file contents stored** — so
PERMISSIONS.md's *"file contents are never stored"* claim stayed TRUE throughout. Seven groups **plus five
discovered tasks**. **SPLIT AT THE PLAN GATE (D-1): 005 = watch; 006 = snapshots + diff.** Detection is a
measured **2×2, not a per-engine split**: Chromium's app page is event-driven (`FileSystemObserver` over a
real handle), everything else polls and compares **content**, because on Firefox's drag path
`size`/`lastModified` are frozen at drop time. **Firefox watch is app-page-only** — a background
`fetch("file://…")` throws under Gecko's URI security policy and no permission grants it. Continuity is
**anchor-based, not `scrollTop`-based** (D-3), which is why **`mount()` stopped being the read-only
library four milestones had treated it as** — additive, defaulted-off, both directions red-first proven.
**★ THE FACT TO CARRY: the 7.1 gate caught a shipping defect (4.8) in the first five minutes, on the
first item checked, on the surface the automated stack provably cannot reach** — watch on the
content-script `file://` surface detected every change and rendered **none** of them. **The score moved to
7/7** *(the running total AT M5's CLOSE; it is **10/10** now — see the score paragraph below)*, its first
move since M3, confirming M4's keep-the-gate reasoning **by instance**: the item M4 kept
*because nothing else could observe it* is the item that caught the defect. The gate's other output was a
**product judgement, not a defect** — the pill is not discoverable, shipped as-is and carried.

**M4 · spec 004 — themes + settings · CLOSED 2026-07-19.** Auto/light/dark (sepia deferred, D-1),
persisted in the existing IndexedDB with **`permissions: []` still intact**, applied coherently across the
app shell and **both** reader surfaces through one theme-host registry, plus the 003 TOC rail's state
carried over as a global preference. Eight groups. **The headline result is a NEGATIVE one and it is the
milestone's best work:** group 4 built the paint gate D-2 specified, measured it, found it breached the
<150 ms budget on **every cold typical-doc open** by a cost **insensitive to the deadline** (75 ms →
172.7 ms; 40 ms → 172.9 ms), and **deleted it** — shipping D-2's own recorded fallback. The 8.1 gate
PASSED **with no defects found** — the first milestone whose gate found nothing, which the retro answers
rather than celebrates (verdict: **discipline-dominant**; the boundary moved for *coherence*, not for
*appearance*, so **the gate stays load-bearing**). It also discharged the three items groups 6–7 deferred
into it. → narrative:

full-tab app page that reads a chosen folder of markdown from disk — shipped **without spending a single
manifest permission** (folder access via user-gesture web APIs; consent is at-use, visible, revocable).
The `FolderSource → MarkdownFile[]` seam is the one engine boundary; everything above it is
engine-agnostic. The 6.3 human gate caught **3** defects the green stack missed (containment ·
drag-navigation · the storage-UI gap). → narrative:

**M1 · spec 001 — core render pipeline · CLOSED 2026-07-14.** The reader itself: detect → hide-raw →
mount → parse → markdown-it/GFM → DOMPurify → shadow-DOM themed reading → Raw toggle →
block-remote-media → never-blank fallback, on Chrome + Firefox, `permissions: []`, ~270 KB packed. Its
gate caught **2** defects, both invisible to jsdom: a pre-opt-in remote-image **fetch leak** (the
"a detached node doesn't fetch" assumption is FALSE — the safe property is an *inert* document) and the
Firefox mount-timing regression. → narrative:

**The human-gate score: 10/10** — M1:2 + M2:3 + M3:1 + M4:0 + M5:1 + **M6:3**. The score counts
**DEFECTS, not milestones**, which is what 9.1's own "8/8" got wrong: its landing block says *"M6
contributes THREE"* and then writes 8/8, contradicting itself. **7 + 3 = 10.** (On the stricter
denominator that also counts the Firefox app-page disclosure gap the 9.1 walk closed it is 11/11; prior
milestones did not count copy gaps, so 10/10 is the like-for-like figure — **stating the denominator's
definition is the point**.)

**★ BUT "NONE ESCAPING" IS NO LONGER TRUE, AND THE QUALIFICATION MATTERS MORE THAN THE NUMBER.** For
five milestones this section read *"all N caught by the milestone-close gate, NONE escaping it."*
**M6's finding A — the reader right-aligning against the TOC rail on wide viewports — ships on BOTH
surfaces and has done SINCE M3**, present and missed at **M3's, M4's and M5's close gates**. So: **nine
of ten were caught at their own gate; one escaped three.** M4's clean gate therefore has a known miss —
its retro's *discipline-dominant* verdict still stands **for what M4 built**, but the gate was not clean
about the shipped product. *A clean gate is evidence about the BUILD, not about the GATE* was M4's own
caveat (retro 2026-07-19); **M6 is where it cashed out.** The mechanical cause is fixable and named:
**no gate record on any milestone states the walk's VIEWPORT** — engine and surface are recorded every
time, the dimension that decides whether a layout defect is visible is not. **Standing rule: a gate walk
records its viewport(s) the way it records its engines, and a milestone shipping positioned chrome walks
at least one WIDE viewport deliberately** (`retro.md` 2026-07-27, finding 2).

**Read the ratio precisely either way:** it says every *known* shipping defect was caught at some gate,
not that the gate catches everything — the denominator only counts what someone eventually found.
**M5 remains the sharpest instance FOR the gate:** task 4.8 was found in the **first five minutes, on
the first item checked, on the surface the automated stack provably cannot reach** (no test on any
milestone has ever exercised the real content→background transport).

**Product progress (rough):** M1 opened build-order phase 1-of-7 (product spec §11). Spec-level
milestones are finer than the 7 phases (roadmap after 001: 002 sources · 003 TOC · 004 themes+settings ·
005 watch · 006 snapshots+diff · … ~a dozen to v1.0), so a precise product % is **deferred** — honestly
this is early foundation, **~sixth of ~12+ spec-milestones**. Don't over-read the fraction.
**The sharper number is now measured rather than guessed:** [`spec-coverage.md`](spec-coverage.md) puts
the whole spec at **~23%** and persona #1 at **~56%**. Prefer it to this paragraph when scoping.

## Baselines / pins
*Current measured truth, **re-measured 2026-07-27 at HEAD `d470ab2`** by the post-M6 archive pass. This
section is MUTABLE — each milestone's close task overwrites the numbers and moves the previous ones into
the "vs" column. It lives here, not in decisions.md, because decisions.md is dated append-only and a
current-numbers table cannot be corrected there without either lying or duplicating.*
*Per-milestone historical pins, and the whole M6-close § Baselines verbatim, are in
[`progress-archive.md` § M6](progress-archive.md#m6--spec-006--snapshots--diff--closed-2026-07-27).*

**★ WHY THIS TABLE WAS RE-MEASURED RATHER THAN CARRIED FORWARD.** The previous table was written at task
8.1 and **B1 v2 and B2 then shipped production code without re-running it** — it was stale by two
commits while calling itself *"current measured truth"* (`retro.md` 2026-07-27, finding 3). **Every
number below is a harness run in this session, not a figure lifted from a commit body.**

| pin | now (2026-07-27, `d470ab2`) | vs 8.1's record | vs M5 close | bound | verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| First paint, typical doc (50.4 KB) | **133.7 ms** (pass 2: **138.3 ms**) | 137.9 ms (**−4.2 ms**) | 138.6 ms (−4.9 ms) | **<165 ms GATE** | **PASS** |
| First paint, 1 MB / ~1400-entry TOC | **1188.5 ms** | 1185.2 ms (+3.3 ms) | 1183.8 ms (+4.7 ms) | <1.7 s (informational) | PASS |
| Content script (`content-scripts/peekover.js`) | **315,671 B** both engines | 315,144 B (**+527**) | 299,411 B (**+16,260, +5.43%**) | none — **stated, not gated** | — |
| App-page chunk (`chunks/app-CEHD9mSZ.js`) | **361,500 B** both engines | 360,423 B (**+1,077**) | 332,895 B (**+28,605, +8.59%**) | none — **stated, not gated** | — |
| Background (`background.js`) | **3,435 B** both engines | 3,435 B (—) | 3,315 B (+120, +3.62%) | none — **stated, not gated** | — |
| `pnpm zip` Chrome / Firefox | **349,744 / 349,803 B** | 349,165 / 349,223 (+579 / +580) | 335.89 / 335.95 kB | <2 MB | **PASS** |
| Suites | **549 unit** (46 files) · **629 passed / 15 skipped** browser, **76 file-instances**, both engines | 605 / 15 / 74 (**+24 cases, +2 files**) | 456 · 499/15/54 | — | green |

**★ READ THE "vs 8.1" COLUMN CORRECTLY: NONE OF IT IS NEW GROWTH.** The +527 / +1,077 / +579 / +580 /
+24-cases deltas are **B1 v2's and B2's**, shipped during the 9.1 recovery and never pinned. This pass
closes that gap; it did not cause it. **Nothing has touched the build since M6 closed** — verified, not
assumed: `git diff a6c7716..d470ab2` over `src/`, `entrypoints/`, `wxt.config.ts`, `package.json` and
`pnpm-lock.yaml` is **empty**, and the §6 side-quest's only code is two standalone `scripts/` tools that
are not in the build graph. **So these bytes are simultaneously the current pins and the true M6-close
pins**, which is why the archive's frozen M6 table carries the same values.

- **THE FIRST-PAINT GATE PASSES ON BOTH PASSES, AND THE FLOOR IS THE HEADLINE.** Pass 1 median
  **133.7 ms** (min 132.4, max 146.5); pass 2 median **138.3 ms** (min 132.1, max 182.2). **Floor across
  both passes: 132.1 ms** — against 8.1's quiesced floor of 133.0 ms (−0.9 ms) and M5-close's 132.0 ms
  (+0.1 ms). On the standing protocol that signal-vs-noise is decided on the FLOOR, **the floor is
  exactly where M5 left it: no regression, and none of 006's +16 KB reaches this path.**
- **ONE WARM ITERATION IN PASS 2 READ 182.2 ms, OVER THE GATE. Recorded, not hidden.** The gated number
  is the median and both medians pass with ~27 ms of headroom; that single max is the same working-day
  machine-state noise 8.1 documented at length (its own passes carried a 166.6 ms max). **The standing
  warning is NOT repealed:** a passing median on a busy machine is luck, not evidence, and any session
  touching the render path should quiesce before believing a number.
- **THE 1 MB FIXTURE IS THE DISCRIMINATOR AND IT CONFIRMS THE MACHINE WAS COMPARABLE.** 1188.5 ms against
  8.1's quiesced 1185.2 ms (+0.3%) — this session's machine is in the same state 8.1's re-runs were
  measured in, which is what licenses comparing the 50 KB numbers against 8.1's at all. The harness line
  still prints `-> FAIL` because it compares the 1 MB fixture against the *typical-doc* bar and
  self-labels the comparison informational (decisions.md 2026-07-14). Against its OWN <1.7 s bound: PASS.
- **Standing pins, all green this session:** `git diff tests/golden/output/` **EMPTY** ·
  `tests/manifest.test.ts` **2975 B, byte-unmodified since M2** (`3b6c575`), `permissions: []` on both
  built manifests · `pnpm lint` EXIT=0 · `vitest.config.ts` and `wxt.config.ts` unmodified.
- **`pnpm zip` emits a THIRD artifact that is NOT the bound:** the Firefox run also writes
  `peekover-0.0.0-sources.zip` (**4.29 MB**, was 3.93 MB at 8.1 — the §6 side-quest's two scripts and the
  `.github/` additions ride in the source archive). It is the archive AMO requires for review, not a
  shipped package. The <2 MB bound is on the extension zips.

**★ THE IMPORT FENCE — THE GREP IS RETRACTED; THE FENCE HOLDS BY ABLATION.** Do not propagate the old
check. Every recorded *"content-script grep for `diffLines|jsdiff|computeDiff|enterDiff|…` = 0"* proved
**nothing**: those are identifiers, the bundle is minified, and the negative control nobody ran until 8.1
— grep the app-page chunk, which indisputably *does* contain the engine — **also returns 0**. The fence
was carried the whole time by the source-text allowlist in `diffEngine.test.ts`, which remains **the
architectural proof**. It was re-established at 8.1 by **controlled ablation**: removing the engine and
view left the content script **byte-identical (0 B, md5-identical, both engines)** and dropped the app
chunk **−9,481 B** — the diff feature's contribution to the gated path is not "small", it is **nil**.
Full ablation tables: archive § M6.

**Replacement heuristic for future measure-tasks — use literals that survive minification, and ALWAYS run
the negative control.** Re-verified this session against the current build:

| marker set | app chunk (CONTROL — must be >0) | content script (FENCE — must be 0) |
|---|---|---|
| `diff` pkg option props — `newlineIsToken\|stripTrailingCr\|ignoreWhitespace\|oneChangePerToken\|maxEditLength` | **12** ✓ fires | **0** ✓ |
| `diffView` strings — `diff could not be rendered\|no reader shadow root to show a diff in` | **2** ✓ fires | **0** ✓ |

Identical on **both engines**. **This is a heuristic, not a proof** — it depends on the minifier
preserving those literals, and a bundler upgrade could silently blunt it exactly as it blunted the old
one. **It is worth something only while its control fires; check that first, every time.** Note that
`peekover-diff` class names DO appear in the content script — **30 hits** for that literal, on both
engines — and this is **correct, not a breach**: `mount.ts` imports `diffChrome.ts` by design, and that
module reaches the engine only through
the `showDiff`/`hideDiff` closures the app page provisions. A fence grep must target the **engine and the
view**, never the string "diff". *(8.1 recorded **36** here under an unstated pattern; this pass measured
**30** for the literal `peekover-diff`. The gap is not reconciled — it is either the recovery commits'
CSS changes or a different pattern, and **the number is decoration either way**: it is the two marker
rows above, with their firing control, that carry the fence's evidence. Stated rather than silently
overwritten.)*

**★ THE TWO 006 HARNESSES, RE-RUN THIS SESSION (`--no-build`). Neither emits an exit-code gate, by
design — they choose nothing.**

**`perf:snapshot-capture` — 7.3's chosen bounds still behave as reasoned.** Accumulation over 12
sequential edits through the production controller: **50 KB → 13 snapshots, 659.5 KB** (`2,3,…,13`;
mean 50.7 KB); **1 MB → 13 snapshots, 14.57 MB** (`2,3,…,13`; every snapshot 1.12 MB). **Neither bound
bites** — 13 < 15 and 14.57 MB < 20 MiB — reproducing 8.1 and 7.3 exactly. **`12 of 12 edits rendered`
at BOTH fixtures**, holding 8.1's discriminator fix (the retracted `9 of 12` was a sampled probe).
**Capture cost remains UNRESOLVABLE at both sizes and the harness says so itself:** 50 KB sync delta
**+7.5 ms** against a 24.4 ms within-arm spread; 1 MB **−5.3 ms** against a 199.3 ms spread — **the sign
flips between fixtures, which is the point. No delta here may be quoted as "the capture cost" in either
direction.** Isolated D-5 guard **2.5 µs / 55.0 µs** (a FLOOR on added work, measured hot — retro
finding 2's ~13× warning stands); awaited `storeSnapshot` **0.7 ms / 7.5 ms**, off the synchronous path
by construction. Non-vacuity held every run: ON captured 2 per run, OFF captured 0.
**STILL NOT OBSERVED and still out of this harness's reach: whether the count bound actually STOPS
growth at 15** — `EDIT_SEQUENCE` is 12, so decisions.md's *"~17 snapshots of 1 MB fit in 20 MiB"* remains
**reasoning, not measurement**.

**`perf:diff` — no movement against 8.1.** (a) engine **635.2 ms** (8.1: 587.5) · (b) parse+sanitize
**444.9 ms** (441.5) · (c) DOM **138.1 ms** *derived* (137.8) · (d) **TOTAL enter 1224.8 ms** (1202.2) ·
first scroll frame **388.5 ms**, settling to 73.6 / 54.3 / 59.2 / 52.9 ms. Fixture determinism holds to
the hunk across a third session: **5882 hunks (1961+ / 1961− / 1960=) → 5882 blocks on all 7 runs.**
(a)+(b)+(c) deliberately do **not** reconcile to (d) — (d) also carries two IDB round-trips, event
dispatch and the browser's own layout of the appended subtree, and that gap is left visible. **Memory
stays DIRECTIONAL ONLY** and the caveats are load-bearing (Chromium-only `performance.memory`, **V8 heap
only — DOM nodes are NOT counted**, GC-timing dependent, non-default flag): heap at rest **15.50 MB**;
before→after enter median **+22.68 MB across a −16.40 to +37.18 MB range**; net before→after-exit median
**+7.05 MB across a −41.46 to +37.57 MB range**. **The spread is printed beside every median precisely
because a single confident median here would be a fiction, and the net is NOT evidence of a clean
teardown.**

**⚠ TOOLING TRAP, recorded so the next session does not lose time to it: `pnpm zip -- -b firefox` SILENTLY
BUILDS CHROME.** There is no `zip:firefox` script; pnpm forwards the bare `--` as a literal argument and
wxt's CLI ignores what follows, so the command exits 0 having rebuilt and rezipped **chrome-mv3** — a
green run that produced the wrong artifact. **The correct invocation is `pnpm exec wxt zip -b firefox`**
(likewise `pnpm exec wxt build -b firefox`). The `pnpm perf -- --size 50kb` form is unaffected — `tsx`
ignores the bare `--`, which is why the perf harnesses never exposed this.

- **Measurement protocol (unchanged since M1 — keep it, so numbers stay comparable):** 7 iterations, run
  1 discarded as cold, **median of the warm 6**, min/max as spread. **No threshold is ever asserted from
  a measurement task** (standing M1 retro rule). **Signal-vs-noise is decided on the FLOOR, not the
  middle** — real added cost raises the floor; noise moves only the middle.
- **Every first-paint number here is CHROMIUM.** `perf-first-paint.ts` cannot drive Firefox
  (decisions.md 2026-07-19, harness ledger). Firefox first paint is evidenced only by the human gate.
- **A pin certifies exactly the stage it observes.** "Golden diff EMPTY ⇒ the reading column is
  untouched" is **FALSE** — that suite snapshots `sanitize(parse(source))`, upstream of `mount()`, and
  stayed empty through the 5.1 chrome addition. Before citing a pin as evidence, break the property and
  check it goes red (retro 2026-07-19, finding 3).
- **And a pin can be perfectly scoped and still be BLIND.** That is the other half, and it is M6's
  (retro 2026-07-27, finding 1): **every empirical claim needs a positive control that fires under the
  same conditions the negative claim disclaims.** Green tells you neither.


### Watch-mode numbers (spec 005 task 5.1, measured 2026-07-21 — `pnpm perf:watch`)
*Same machine and protocol as the table above. **NOT a gate**: no threshold is asserted. Re-run twice at
6.1 and the numbers did not move — **`perf-watch.ts` calls `mount()` and `observerDetector` directly and
never drives `watchController`, so it is structurally blind to 5.3's cooldown.** A moved number here would
have needed a different explanation than "the cooldown".*

**(b) RE-RENDER COST — production's own `mount(text, host, {preserveReading:true})`, real headless Chromium,
on the REAL content-script `<peekover-root>` and on the app page's `.peekover-app__reader` pane shape.**

| ms (median of warm 6) | 50 KB full-page | 50 KB contained | 1 MB full-page | 1 MB contained |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **shipped mount, SYNCHRONOUS** | **34.9** | **35.7** | **717.3** | **713.9** |
| shipped, start → 2nd rAF | 49.8 | 49.7 | 811.5 | 806.3 |
| plain mount, synchronous (control) | 16.8 | 17.0 | 359.9 | 379.3 |
| plain, start → 2nd rAF (control) | 49.9 | 49.8 | 801.6 | 845.4 |
| parse+sanitize only | 12.5 | 12.7 | 266.8 | 261.6 |

- **READ THE TWO ROWS TOGETHER OR YOU WILL DRAW THE WRONG CONCLUSION.** Continuity doubles the SYNCHRONOUS
  block but adds **≈0 ms at 50 KB** and **nothing distinguishable from noise at 1 MB** (+9.9 full-page,
  −39.1 contained, against a plain-path spread of 793–908) to the **whole** unresponsive window.
  `restoreReadingAnchor` reads `getBoundingClientRect` after the commit and forces layout the plain path
  pays a frame later regardless. **Layout MOVED, not ADDED** — reproduced on the 6.1 re-runs, with the two
  surfaces moving in **opposite** directions (+24.1 / −24.8 ms), i.e. noise around zero.
- **Non-vacuity, proven per cell:** with the changed block INSERTED ABOVE, the shipped path moved the scroll
  box **2738 px** to hold the reader's place while the plain control moved it **0 px** — on both surfaces.
- **BOTH SURFACES NOW RE-RENDER, and this corrects what this section said before task 4.8.** The table's
  contained column governs the app page (`appShell.ts`), but the content script is **no longer** the
  never-re-rendering surface the pre-4.8 note described — it registers a real `createWatchController` too.
  Its cost is the full-page column.

**(a) OBSERVER LATENCY — programmatic write → `observerDetector` callback, no human in the loop.**

| | 50 KB | 1 MB |
|---|---|---|
| **close() → detector cb** | **18.7 ms** | **109.5 ms** |
| write (createWritable…close) | 2.2 ms | 4.2 ms |
| per-tick read (`getFile().text()`) | 0.6 ms | 2.4 ms |

- **★ THE INFERENCE IS CONFIRMED — MEASURED ON LOCAL DISK AT THE 7.1 GATE, 2026-07-21 (task 5.1a).** With
  a production build loaded and a real picker-opened folder rewritten from outside the browser: **a small
  file updates INSTANTLY; the 1 MB file updates in A FEW MILLISECONDS.** The OPFS numbers **did NOT
  under-predict local disk**, so 5.2's named revisit trigger did not fire.
- **THE TABLE'S PROVENANCE IS STILL OPFS and the confirmation does not overwrite it.** 18.7 / 109.5 ms
  were measured on **OPFS**, the only handle obtainable without a user gesture (`showDirectoryPicker`
  opens a native dialog Playwright cannot drive — recorded M2 limit); no local-disk number was faked then
  or invented now. **The gate instrument is COARSER than the harness instrument** — a human cannot resolve
  18.7 from 109.5 ms and did not try — so 5.1a confirms a **magnitude class**, not a rival figure. *(Why
  the confirmation was worth a task, and why it is the counter-example to retro finding 2: `decisions.md`
  2026-07-21.)*
- **The task-0 probe's 5127 ms is RETIRED** — it was human reaction time. Never quote it as a latency.
- **The 1 MB latency cell looks unstable and is not:** 5.1 read 109.5 ms, the 6.1 passes 130.4 / 126.4 ms,
  but the second pass's own spread is **100.5–132.7 ms**, a band *containing* 109.5. **50 KB is stable
  across all three passes (18.7 / 19.3 / 18.3)** — the control that makes the 1 MB band read as
  fixture-size variance rather than instrument drift.
- **CHROMIUM ONLY, twice over:** Playwright cannot load an extension into Firefox, and `FileSystemObserver`
  does not exist on Firefox (measured, task 1.2). Firefox's app-page watch (drag-opened folders) IS a
  shipped surface, so **its re-render cost is UNMEASURED** and evidenced only at 7.1.
- **Fidelity residual, stated:** the content script's isolated world exports nothing, so `perf-watch.ts`
  bundles the same SOURCE with esbuild (via `tsx`'s own dependency — no devDependency added) and evaluates
  it in the page. Production source, not the production build artifact; and the bundle's own registry holds
  no watch target, so the measured mount omits the watch pill. No measurement-only code ships.
