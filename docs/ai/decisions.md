# Decisions — Peekover
*Append-only. Newest first. Format: date · decision · why · revisit-when.*

- **2026-07-14 · Lowercase-only file:// match patterns.** `isRenderableContext()` is
  case-insensitive, but the manifest `file:///*.<ext>` patterns are lowercase, so a local file with
  an UPPERCASE extension (e.g. `README.MD`) won't trigger browser injection. Why: doubling every
  file:// pattern to cover uppercase is a poor tradeoff for a rare case; raw hosts are host-matched
  and unaffected, and most local files use lowercase extensions. Revisit-when: we next touch match
  patterns (Firefox/manifest task 2.3 or folder-mode), or if a user actually reports it.
- **2026-07-11 · Name: Peekover** (DocPeek withdrawn — live App Store collision). Eight-surface
  verification passed; domain peekover.dev owned+verified. Full record: names.md in design archive.
- **2026-07-11 · Umbrella ship model:** repo under github.com/mosuvo/peekover (personal), org
  `peekover` dormant insurance, one publisher account for all future free tools, hello@peekover.dev
  public contact, no product X handle. Revisit: if a tool needs contributors/governance.
- **2026-07-10 · Brand: monochrome + one highlighter.** No chromatic accent (indigo/orange/red all
  rejected — clashed with yellow). Interactive = ink + highlighter underline. Logo internals fixed-ink.
- **2026-07-09 · Stack: WXT + markdown-it + DOMPurify + Shiki + KaTeX + Mermaid + CM6.** One
  battle-tested parser over hand-rolled; WXT over Plasmo (maintenance, MV3+Firefox story).
  Revisit: only if 5MB budget breaks.
- **2026-07-09 · Zero-network default is architecture, not policy** — no code path may fetch
  without explicit user trigger + indicator. Revisit: never.
- **2026-07-08 · Strategy: markdown wedge → universal raw viewer (Phase 2).** Free forever,
  credibility play, $0 infra.
